# Mental-Health-Tracker
This was made at hths.hacks() 2021 in 24 hours

# Requirements
Tkinter, ttkthemes, requests, webbrowser

# Inspiration
We are all involved in an organization called "Active Minds" which helps to educate people about and destigmatize mental health.

# What it does
Users take a short quiz to determine how their day went to track long-term trends in their mental health, which can be accessed through a calendar.

# How we built it
We used Python and JSON for the backend with Tkinter for the GUI. We also used requests to show user a daily quote.

# Challenges we ran into
At first, we thought we could just create a quiz with a calendar, but soon realized we would need a method to store users' previous inputs. Had to use store and get data on a JSON file

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Getting the calendar to change color and being able to add multiple data points to the JSON file

# What we learned
How to use JSON, how to use Tkinter, developing a GUI, and using requests.

# What's next for Mental Health Tracker
Google calendar integration
